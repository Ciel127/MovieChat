The team searched the house and they didnâ€™t see any unusual objects. The machine showed that the signal come from underground, but this house didn't have a basement, they felt very strange. However, one person in the team found the bookcase and the door. They immediately took the elevator to the underground. The children heard the sound of the elevator, so they hid and planned to escape from the garage. But the team also noticed there were someone in the room and sealed off this place.",
