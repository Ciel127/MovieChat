    "caption": "The video opens with a female motorcyclist apparently fleeing from the police, who eventually apprehend her. Meanwhile, in another part of the city, a bald man in a car is causing havoc. The police attempt to stop him but are unable to prevent him from reaching a massive spherical bomb. The bald man strikes the bomb into the water, triggering a massive explosion that affects nearly half of the city. In the aftermath, it is shown that the suspects involved in the bombing have been detained by the police. The scene then shifts to a secretive base, presumably a law enforcement headquarters where two high-ranking officers are having a heated debate over how to deal with the suspects involved in the bomb incident.",
