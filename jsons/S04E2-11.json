 "caption": "In a room, a security guard stood by a door, and he suddenly realized that the door wouldn't open. He pushed against the door with force, and a woman spoke to him. Inside that room, a man wearing a light blue shirt was mockingly looking at another man lying on a hospital bed. He voiced his intent to kill the bedridden man. Outside, people were trying hard to force open the door, and they finally broke it down. The attempt to murder was thwarted, and the man in the blue shirt was very defiant. He believed there was no evidence against him, but the man in the bed produced a recorder hidden inside his walking cane. The defiant man's demeanor changed to a serious one. He was then taken to the police station, where he confessed everything. Later, in another room, a man and a woman talked with him.",
