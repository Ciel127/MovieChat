    "caption": "Jonas discovered Camellia and planned to take her away. Fortunately, Vesper and the robot rushed back. They got into a fight with Jonas and finally controlled him. Vesper did not kill Jonas and let him go. Jonas immediately contacted the people in the citadel and told them the location of Camellia. That night, the soldiers in the citadel launched an attack on Vesper's house. Vesper wanted to escape with her father, but her father said he had worked for the citadel before and the soldiers would definitely not kill him. He could help Vesper and Camellia to escape. Although Vesper was unwilling, she didn’t have a better idea. In the end, they left Vesper’s father at home and escaped through the back door.",
