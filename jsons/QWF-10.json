All of them rushed forward, facing the fire and the shells, and many of them fell and were shot dead in the way. A young recruit rushed into an enemy trench and fought with an enemy soldier. Confronted by an enemy soldier of his own age, the soldier hesitated, and a friendly soldier next to him shot the enemy in the head. When soldiers occupy enemy trenches, it is enemy tanks that appear on the battlefield. The soldiers' machine guns did no damage to the tanks, and faced with the tanks, the infantry were routed. Many were killed by tank shells and run over by tank tracks.",
