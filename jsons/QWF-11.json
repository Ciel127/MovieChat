    "caption": "The video tells of numerous scenes of panic among many soldiers after tanks intervened in the infantry battle. All the soldiers ran back helplessly. Several soldiers jammed grenades into the tank's tracks and managed to stop the tank and kill its driver. In the constant running and fighting, the hero gradually fainted on the battlefield. Then the enemy took out the rows of flamethrowers and attacked the remaining soldiers in the trenches. A soldier caught fire and ran desperately to his death. The camera cuts to a compartment where a number of politicians are engaged in a heated discussion, seemingly trying to end the war.",
