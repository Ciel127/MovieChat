He immediately started repairing it. At the same time, the people of the aircraft company found a team of mercenaries to search for the plane. The captain fixed the phone and contacted the company. But the companyâ€™s operator thought it was a scam call and ignored it. Afterwards, he called his daughter and asked her to tell the company to rescue them.
