After going through the case details, they follow a lead to a crime syndicate's hideout and conduct a search. They apprehend all the criminals who resist, but a small number manage to escape. The scene then shifts to the escaped criminals, who are in a rundown house, seemingly discussing their next move. One of the criminals appears to be on the verge of breaking down, while another seems relatively calm.",
