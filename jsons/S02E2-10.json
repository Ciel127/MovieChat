 "caption": "one individual and another were investigating the case of a murdered young man when they were drugged, leading both of them to have hallucinations. In the end, it was discovered that all this happened because they ate sugar from the young man's house, which had been laced with a drug. Key points include: both of them were drugged while investigating the young man's case; they both had hallucinations, with one of them seeing a huge hound; it was found that they were drugged because of the sugar they ate from the young man's home; they suspected it might be a hallucinogen or psychoactive drug; but it was later found that the sugar was infused with jellyfish genes; this led to a realization that there might be deeper things at play; one of them discovered that the young man had also seen the hound, but the other hadn't; it turned out the reason the latter wasn't affected by the drug was because he didn't drink coffee and therefore didn't consume the sugar; all these events were a cover-up for human cloning experiments, and the cloned animals were not just sheep but larger animals; in the end, it was realized that all of this was a cover-up for a deeper truth, and they had to leave the place.",
