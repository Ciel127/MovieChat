The scene then shifts to an elderly person suffering from Alzheimer's disease, who is being treated poorly by a caregiver. The caregiver refuses to feed the elderly person, who then wanders alone into a restaurant and begins to eat leftover food. A man observes this situation; initially, he considers ignoring it, but eventually, his compassion overwhelms him. He takes the elderly person back to his home to care for him and ensure he has a proper meal.",
