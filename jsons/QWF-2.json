The next shot shows a young man riding his bike to school in a small town. And went to class laughing and talking with a few other students. Then all the students gathered at the stairs to listen to a leader's speech. The leader's speech was so inspiring that the students were inspired. The next scene tells the story of the students queuing up to receive their military uniforms and other equipment and marching in neat rows to the front line.",
