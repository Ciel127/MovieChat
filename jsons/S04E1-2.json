 "caption": "In the darkness, which seems to be at night, two men dressed in black ascend a staircase, talking as they walk. The next morning, in a room, there are five people. A man and a woman sit on a couch, holding a child between them. They appear to be happily discussing something with the people next to them, laughing heartily, and it looks like a baptism ceremony. A man is baptizing a child, and later they are on a bus. After that, they are again in a room where a man and a woman are conversing. Then, the man receives a phone call. At night, a car is driving but doesn't stop and crashes into the car in front of it, leading to a massive fire.",
