Concurrently, they discover research related to biochemical weapons, which causes them concern. Ultimately, they decide to investigate further to unveil the truth. Although they planned a fishing trip, one doesn’t show up, having witnessed something horrifying. The discovery of secret military labs conducting frightful experiments, an encounter with Dr. Franklin who harbors secrets, and uncovering research into biochemical weaponry that raises concerns all amalgamate into their unnerving adventure. Dr. Franklin appears interested in their investigation but also emerges as suspicious. They find some monkeys, but there’s an oddity about them. Reiteratively, they resolve to delve deeper into their investigative endeavor, aiming to expose the concealed veracity within the daunting biochemical research and the peculiar occurrences enveloping them.",
