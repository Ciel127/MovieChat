The host said that in six months, the British army would occupy Sicily, and before that, it was necessary to make the German army think that Britain will attack from Greece, so that they would transfer some soldiers from Sicily to other places. In the end, they made a plan. They needed to find a corpse, disguised him as drowning and put a fake letter on him to deceive the Germans. The location to drop the body was determined to be the sea near Spain, as Spain was a neutral country so there were many spies from both sides.",
