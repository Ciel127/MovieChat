 "caption": "A man receives a picture of himself wearing a hat, indicating that Christmas has been canceled. He discovers a gift left for him and believes it's from a certain woman. When she arrives, another man informs the first man that she's meeting her boyfriend later that night. The second man spots some pictures of them, re-emphasizing the cancellation of Christmas. The woman comes in, and the second man repeats to the first man about her rendezvous with her boyfriend. The second man encounters the images once more, restating the cancelation. The woman presents an image of a deceased individual, with the second man identifying her as a particular lady. The man hypothesizes this lady might be dead. The first man questions how one can recognize the particular lady from the deceased's face, and it's explained it's due to her phone. The woman shows more photos of the deceased, with the second man confirming it's indeed the particular lady. The man deduces she might be no more and she hands over a phone. It's discovered that the lady once had the first man's phone, suggesting her demise. The woman shares more images, with the man reaffirming her fate. The second man discovers her phone multiple times, each instance pondering her possible demise.",
