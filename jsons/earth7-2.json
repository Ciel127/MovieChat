 "caption": "This video introduces the lives of grass and snowbirds that grow in the great ocean cave and their relationship. The grassland is the largest grassland on Earth, supporting nearly 200 million grasses annually. Both grass and tree leaves are cultivated by honey and can recover within a few days. Grass cannot touch the ocean and can only support each other with volcanoes. Even the frozen glass in the winter can allow them to continue growing. Snowbirds fly nearly 3,000 kilometers each year and take three months to reach the great ocean cave. Five million birds fly over here every year. Snowbirds live in the great ocean cave for three weeks, burying their eggs, which is very dangerous. Arabian foxes wait for ants to test the birds, which may bring danger to them. Grassland great ocean snowbirds life relationship flight bury danger.",
