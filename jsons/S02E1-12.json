The detective informs him that he's discovered a mobile phone along with a password. This password can unlock the phone and erase its hard drive. The detective also identifies a woman who seems quite intrigued by him, though he's largely indifferent. In the end, he decides to imprison the woman, but his sibling wishes for her release. The sibling presents a list of demands and hopes that the detective would leave this place and choose his own path in life. While the detective doesn't regard his sibling as a scientist or philosopher, he opts for the role of an investigator. The sibling wishes to evaluate the detective's heart. Furthermore, the detective stumbles upon a woman who appears notably interested in him.",
