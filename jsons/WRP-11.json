The woman first stabbed the man with a knife, then burned him with the heat of a hot kettle while he was in a chokehold and escaped from the hut. The man grabbed the woman as she tried to escape from the cabin in a car. The woman's father arrived and tried to shoot the man, but his pistol failed to fire. A black male policeman in the forest finally arrived and shot the robber with a gun. The woman's father took the woman and other injured members of the group to the car and told them to leave. He confronted the man in the forest before police arrived.",
