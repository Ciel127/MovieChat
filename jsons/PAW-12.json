However, they did not have so much time to wait, the separatists were still hunting them. The captain suddenly came up with an idea, he wanted to restart the plane. When they arrived, the captain expressed his thoughts to the passengers. Everyone felt it was dangerous, but they had no choice, so they all returned to the plane. The captain and co-pilot began repairing the equipment. The advance team and Gaspare fought with the separatists once again. When Gaspare replenished his ammunition, he accidentally discovered a bag of money, he came up with another plan.",
