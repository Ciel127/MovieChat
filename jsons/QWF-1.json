The next shot cuts to a battlefield where there are numerous casualties, many soldiers running in the trenches, many soldiers rushing to the front line to fight, and the battlefield is strewn with fallen soldiers. The next shot depicts a number of people disposing of dead soldiers. They removed all the clothes, shoes and helmets from the body and buried it in a coffin. The body's clothes and shoes were transported to be washed.",
