In his moment of utmost vulnerability, his girlfriend finally locates him. Dropping everything she has with her, she rushes to him and embraces him tightly, offering him comfort and support. The man is subsequently admitted to the hospital where he receives medical treatment. Inside the hospital, he experiences a semblance of peace, recovering from the physical and possibly emotional wounds that have befallen him. Outside, his girlfriend waits, showing her dedication and love, anticipating the day he will be discharged and they can resume their lives together.",
