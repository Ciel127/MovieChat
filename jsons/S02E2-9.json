They decide to seek this dog in Brasko Burg Shed. Noteworthy points include the lack of options as the video creator has passed away, satisfaction with the video creator's arrival, an intent to reconstruct faces, the destruction of one's dog, a necessity for the video creator to view 'Big Malmor,' potential danger related to the video creator's ID, and a decision made by the two individuals to search for the pestilent dog at Brasko Burg Shed. Additionally, there is a mention of welcoming a booking of a horse, with no specific names utilized.",
