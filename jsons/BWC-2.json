Of course, there are also their natural enemies in the woods, and a bird is looking for his food. The same species of mice in the woods are afraid of this predator, and they build small holes in the stones to inhabit. And there are more than one bird here, from owls standing on branches to eagles flying in the sky. Finally, a class of dogs that also live here are introduced.",
