The soldier outside the wall, through a crack in the door, saw his friend being chased by hounds and the owner of the house, but at last he managed to run away with a goose. The scene then cuts to a wooden house where a number of ex-soldiers gather to stew the goose. These veterans are peeling potatoes here, living a comfortable life, the young recruits look at this scene, thoughtfully.",
