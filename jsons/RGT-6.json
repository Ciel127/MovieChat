But they had many enemies, the most powerful of them was the mermaid. Once upon a time, there was a war between the krakens and the mermaids. The mermaids had a powerful weapon, the Trident. Although the krakens won in the end, the trident disappeared. Grandma hoped that Ruby could go and find it. With the Trident, they could eliminate the mermaids. On the way home, Ruby was caught by a boat. At that moment, Chelsea appeared and saved her. Surprisingly, Chelsea's true identity was a mermaid.",
