 "caption": "A man hands another man a bag of broken statue pieces, and the recipient looks elated, seemingly having been searching for these items for a while. He then places a piece of the statue under a microscope for analysis and observes a blood-red substance, which appears to be blood. Noticing the traces of blood on the statue, they leave the scene. He then approaches a portly individual and borrows a dog from him. They take this dog to a couple's house and engage in friendly conversation with the couple. Subsequently, the three individuals and the dog set off in search of something. However, the dog eventually leads them to a slaughterhouse, making them unable to find what they were looking for. It appears the dog couldn't track the desired item. That night, the couple is seen lying in bed, with their child nestled between them, radiating an aura of contentment and happiness.",
