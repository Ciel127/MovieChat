The survivor was terrified, but other veterans of the war were not, and this shocked the young man. Suddenly a firebomb streaked across the sky, and the enemy continued their fierce attack. Several of the recruits hid in the trenches of the cabin room, very nervous. In the end, the account failed to hold up and collapsed, crushing everyone inside. On the second day, the new recruit got up in disgrace and found that he was not dead. An old soldier handed him a piece of bread and he began to eat.",
