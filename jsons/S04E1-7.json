They want to put someone into beer, but they believe he wouldn't agree since he used to work with a woman. The highlights include the two facing a crisis and trying to find a solution, their plan to put someone into beer, their belief that this person would not consent, the past association of this person with the woman, their search for someone to assist, their concerns about being shot if the person approaches, their repeated mention of \"Braward\", their desire for assistance while fearing for their safety, and their eventual decision not to let that person come. The video showcases finding solutions in crises and self-protection.",
