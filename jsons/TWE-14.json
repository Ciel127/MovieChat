    "caption": "The video follows a team that travels to Earth's engine core in an attempt to restart the engine. In the video, the team is divided into three branches, and the branch led by the brother goes to the inside of the core to replace the core. A middle-aged man entered the machine room full of power cables to debug. A team led by his sister tried to communicate with the outside world and ask for help. With the system in disrepair, my brother had to take the risk himself. Risking her life, she went deep into the heart of the furnace to try to crack it. On the other hand, her sister finally communicated with the outside world through her sincere and unremitting efforts.",
