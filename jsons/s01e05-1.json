 "caption": "This is a wonderful epic series clip. The background of it is in middle age. It starts with something like an opening scene, where a map is continuously expanding. On the map, there is a castle under construction and trees that seem to be growing, but these trees and the castle appear to be made of building blocks. Then, we move to a place that is a stable, with a small tent beside it. Inside the tent, a man is lying on a bed, and he appears to be in a critical condition. People around him are taking care of him, and one man is questioning something, but the answers from the others do not satisfy him. After that, he leaves the tent and walks while conversing with others.In a room, a king is reprimanding his subordinates, who dare not speak up in anger. The king looks very furious. At this moment, the person who was asking questions earlier walks in, and the king immediately starts conversing with him joyfully.",
