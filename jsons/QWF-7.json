The veteran then went to a sunshade in the forest and asked the literate recruit to read the letter to him. As the recruits read, the man's expression was very rich and very excited. It then cuts to night, when a soldier sneaks back into the barracks with a piece of clothing and sniffs it. The soldier beside me also sniffed the clothes he had taken.",
