 "caption": "A girl found herself at the point of a man's sword, frozen in fear. While she was negotiating with the man, the sun was setting rapidly. Seizing an opportunity when the man was momentarily distracted, she suddenly dashed away. The man, now infuriated, pursued her relentlessly. Eventually, he caught up with her and pinned her to the ground, sword at her throat. However, the girl remained defiant.Meanwhile, in another location, a group of people traveled by boat to enter a castle. They faced opposition from the local populace, and tensions ran high. They deployed troops to suppress the dissenting crowd, resulting in a bloodbath. The leader of this group, a young man, appeared extremely anxious as he was surrounded and attacked by the people upon their return to the castle.",
