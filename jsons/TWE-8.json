A group of people support each other in a frozen high-rise building, carrying important props in a natural disaster. The grandfather of one of the sons was trapped in the building in order to save one of the team members. The crowd watched as his vital signs faded. The scene then switches to memories of how, many years before the natural disaster, when the city was flooded, the grandfather saved a child from the hands of the victims and adopted it as his own daughter.",
