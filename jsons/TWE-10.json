During this time, members of the original team of the car realized that they were not regular rescue workers and had an argument with the brother and sister. On the other side, the original brother and sister team has lost their vehicles and other equipment, and can only drag a huge starting key on the ice, and in order to maintain the power of the key, a person's power to maintain vital signs has been sacrificed. The party imploded, and one member shot the key, ending the drain. The brother and sister's team then drove to the team and allied with them again to support other areas.",
