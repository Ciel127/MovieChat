Afterwards, the soldiers arrived at Vesper's house and found nothing except the father who was paralyzed in bed. In order to buy enough time for Vesper, he used that robot to ignite the house and sacrificed himself. Vesper turned around and saw the house on fire, she immediately understood everything. She rushed back to the house, crying and shouting, but was stopped by Camellia. After a while, they calmed down, continued to flee because they saw other soldiers walking towards them in the darkness.",
