 "caption": "In this episode's video, we'll follow the creatures of the deepest parts of the Earth's surface as they dive to the bottom of the ocean, confronting darkness and immense water pressure. At the seabed, organisms and organic particles float in the darkness. Sea spiders use feathery appendages to prevent sinking. The sawtooth eel hovers motionless, waiting for its prey. One of the most peculiar creatures of the deep is the hellish blood-sucking demon fish. The pressure at the seabed is 300 times that of the surface. There are signs of life on the ocean floor, with sea urchins and shrimp sifting through sediments. Far from the continental edges, vast plains stretch for thousands of miles.",
