In the end, they found Ruby behind a tower. She was very scared, and her mother kept comforting her. After a while, Ruby's body returned to normal size and they went home together. At home, Ruby's parents drove away the uncle and told Ruby the truth, that their family were all krakens. Ruby couldn't accept it and she felt that her parents were still hiding something to her, so she planned to find and ask her uncle.",
