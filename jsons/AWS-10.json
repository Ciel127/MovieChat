Without any explanation, they start attacking the customers in the shop and even smash a customer's car. The man initially retreats but is injured by the attackers, prompting him to fight back. It seems he enters a state of frenzy as he manages to repel the attackers. Following the altercation, he is taken to the hospital, where the doctors suspect he is suffering from a psychological disorder due to his erratic behavior during the incident. The medical staff informs his family that he will need to undergo psychiatric treatment.",
