 "caption": "This video introduces various seabed communities on Earth, including the fissures in the Pacific seafloor and volcanic eruptions near the Gal√°pagos Islands. These seabed communities are teeming with diverse life forms such as giant tube worms, soft corals, whip corals, sponges, and nautilus. One of the creatures is the nautilus, which has an elegant shell that allows it to control its depth, but it can't swim like squids and octopuses. Its main predator is the octopus, but the nautilus has well-developed chemical receptors that can detect potential threats. The lives of these creatures are influenced by underwater conditions like volcanic eruptions and cold currents. The volcanic eruptions can create massive underwater mountain ranges, and the marine life is deeply impacted by the seabed environment.",
