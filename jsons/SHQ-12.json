The teacher came back with the energy ball, but she didn’t give it to the boss. In fact, she had already found that this ‘uncle’ was not a good person. She gave it to the child and helped him to run away. The child ran into a dance hall, and the boss followed behind. At this moment, Jack rushed in, he saw the boss and immediately fought with him. But without the suit, he couldn't win at all.",
