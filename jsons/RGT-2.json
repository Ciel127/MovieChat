Ruby planned to invite Connor (a male classmate of Ruby), but she didn't know how to speak up. In the end, she borrowed a confetti cannon from a friend and planned to use it to invite Connor. After class, Ruby found Connor by the sea. While they were chatting, Ruby accidentally activated the confetti cannon. Connor was startled and fell into the sea. And Ruby also jumped down to save him.",
