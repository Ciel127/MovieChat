However, their hideout is discovered by a group of people, prompting the man to flee with the child in a custom-modified vehicle. This car is equipped with rocket launchers, which he uses to blast through a blockade set up by their pursuers, clearing the way forward. Seeing this, the antagonist is infuriated and takes to his own vehicle to give chase, leading to a dramatic and intense pursuit on the highway.",
