The captain walked out of the cockpit and arrived in the cabin. All the passengers, mercenaries and flight attendants applauded. They said that he was the best pilot. After everyone left, the captain stayed alone in the plane. He looked around, recalled everything he had experienced and shed tears. Finally, he stepped out of the plane and sat on the stairs. He took out his phone and called his daughter. 'I'm going home now.' he said.",
