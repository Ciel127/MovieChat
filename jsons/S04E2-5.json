 "caption": "A traffic policeman is on the phone, initially appearing nonchalant, but his expression suddenly turns serious, indicating the caller might be his superior. In a room, a man is causing chaos, creating a huge mess. People nearby are scared off, but a woman, referred to without her name per your request, rushes over with a teacup in hand. The man is wielding a gun, waving it around recklessly. The woman is startled, causing her to drop her tea. The man quickly tries to catch the spilled tea. Seeing an opportunity, she manages to disarm and subdue him. She then takes him to a doctor who is the man's friend. The doctor and his wife welcome the man, both appearing very distressed. At that moment, the doctor receives a phone call. A cocky man in a white shirt is on the line, displaying a very arrogant demeanor. The doctor then shows his displeasure towards the chaotic man.",
