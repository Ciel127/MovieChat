The British deliberately used that phone to communicate, so the German would know that there were important messages on the dead. At the same time, Britain also sent an urgent telegram to Spain, told them to return the documents as soon as possible and do not to let the German know. The German spies were deceived, but Spain protected those files very well, and the German had no chance to see them. The remains would be sent back to Britain soon, and the team members were very anxious.",
