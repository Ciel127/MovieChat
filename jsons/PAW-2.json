Suddenly, the plane flew into a storm and jolted. The captain immediately went to the cabin to check the situation. He said that the plane had encountered the bad weather. He demanded the passengers to sit in their seats and fasten their seat belts. When the captain planned to return, a lightning bolt hit the plane. The plane shook more violently, all the lights went out and the cabin became pitch black.",
