After arguing and working with his companions, the man decided to walk up the stairs in search of the terrorist. Evading the gaze of surveillance cameras, they opened an elevator shaft and climbed up until they reached a studio where they saw their female colleagues being held captive. The man kicked in the studio door and found the terrorist. The man put a sharp object to the terrorist's throat and demanded that he put an end to the drama. The terrorist then pulled out a remote control and said that if it was pressed, it would detonate the bomb throughout the building.",
