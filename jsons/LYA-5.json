He ultimately succeeds in launching and lands on an unknown planet. At that moment, his spacecraft is hijacked by a group of mysterious individuals. It's thanks to a local who assists him that he avoids being discovered by this group. He learns that these mysterious individuals come from a much larger spacecraft and seem to have malevolent intentions. Fortunately, a local finds him and reveals the truth about the situation, after which they return together to the local base.",
