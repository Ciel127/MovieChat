She took Camellia to a place with many red bushes. They passed through the bushes carefully and without touching them. But the soldiers did not know these creatures, when they arrived, they directly stepped on them. In an instant, many insects flew out of the bushes and killed two soldiers. Camellia believed that the soldiers were only here to catch herself and she should not implicate Vesper. After Vesper fell asleep, she left quietly.",
