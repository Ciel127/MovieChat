When the man and his companion entered and saw a man sitting in a chair, when they turned the chair only to find that the man was dead, this was an elaborate design by the terrorists. The two men have no choice but to continue to follow the instructions of the terrorists back to the first floor, only to find that the police have surrounded the entire building, but after learning that there are bombs and dangerous terrorists in the building, the police allow the two men to continue to fight with the terrorists.",
