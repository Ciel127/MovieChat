 "caption": "He comes to him for help investigating his father's death, having recently found some footprints he suspects were left by a gigantic monkey. The inquirerâ€™s father was violently killed, his body never found, and upon examining, he notices that the inquirer had no milk for breakfast but drank black coffee and soy sauce. His girlfriend is the reason he returned to Dartmoor; she believes he needs to confront his demons. Discovering footprints suspected to be from a huge monkey, he suggests the prints might be from impoverished people or other animals. Ultimately confessing, the inquirer admits the footprints were indeed from the gigantic monkey. He is asked to repeat his truthful words to accept evidence and, in the end, he accepts the inquirer's evidence, assisting him in solving the mystery.",
