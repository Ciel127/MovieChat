The next scene shows the robber daring the woman into the woods. The woman rushed the robber to a trap and severely attacked the robber, but the robber was not killed because of the woman's chokehold, and finally the robber tied the woman and himself together. In the next scene, the woman's father, a white-haired old man, also follows the woman's phone to the forest.",
