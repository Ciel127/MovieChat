Not far away, a group of people surrounded Connor and a girl. The girl's name was Chelsea, and it is said that she saved Connor. Suddenly, Ruby felt unwell and her hands began to glow. She immediately left the crowd and ran into the library. However, the situation did not improve, her body grew bigger and bigger, and finally burst the entire library. Not far away, Ruby's mother saw this scene. She immediately drove towards Ruby.",
