However, after the discussion, he realizes his errors, and the boss no longer reprimands him harshly. Their conversation ends with a toast. The next day, the man discovers a drawing in his car, made by his daughter. Through the drawing, he's reminded of his daughter and wife. He realizes he's been neglecting his family for too long because of work, so he drives to see them. He visits his wife and daughter and discusses certain matters with his wife.",
