 "caption": "This video showcases the importance of seafood in the marine ecosystem. The enormous seafood in the ocean supports the majority of marine life, yet their contributions are often little-known to people. The video also introduces other organisms in the ocean, such as dragonflies and sharks, which play crucial roles in the marine ecosystem.Dragonflies and sharks both play vital roles in the marine ecosystem. Sharks' bellies are consumed by other sharks, creating a cycle in the ocean. South African sharks create a sufficient support system for over a million oceans. Shark currents drive marine life to the ocean surface.",
