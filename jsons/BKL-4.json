While he is chatting with the little girl, the criminal he had handcuffed to the car manages to deceive a young boy into unlocking the handcuffs and escapes. He then steals a truck and speeds away. Realizing his mistake, the policeman starts a car chase after the escaped convict. In the end, there's a train crash at an intersection, and the fugitive escapes on foot. The police officer fails to apprehend him.",
