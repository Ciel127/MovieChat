The criminal tries to persuade the officer to stop chasing him, but the officer refuses. After a brutal close-quarters fight, the officer defeats the criminal and successfully apprehends him. After defeating him, the officer throws the criminal off the bus. Soon after, police reinforcements arrive and handle the aftermath. The officer is then reunited with his loved one, embracing them. In the end, the criminals receive their just punishment, and the officer is recovering in a hospital room. As his family visits him, the officer shows a contented smile.",
