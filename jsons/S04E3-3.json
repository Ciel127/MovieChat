 "caption": "A little girl uses a match to set a house on fire. Bystanders watch as ashes fill the sky, their faces filled with sorrow. The scene then shifts, and they are back in the room from which they fled, anticipating what's next due to some issues they faced. The scene changes again to a fortress where it seems someone is imprisoned. The fortress is situated on an island, appearing to be a safe haven until a plane flies in carrying a bomb. The inhabitants are filled with terror, realizing they are under threat. They spot the female owner of the house downstairs in the kitchen, indicating she's safe. They then countdown \"three, two, one\" and rush out, flames spewing behind them. They jump from the second floor, fortunately escaping unharmed. The scene shifts again, and they are on a boat. They hijack the boat, setting course to an unspecified destination.",
