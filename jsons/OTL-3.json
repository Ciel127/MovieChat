The middle-aged man first scolded the newcomer and threatened him to leave, then told him it was just a joke. In such a lively atmosphere, the three began the radio program this evening. The man makes telephone connections with various people, listens to their stories and appeals, and offers his offer and comfort. So the time passed faster and faster, and after several hours, the radio program was about to end.",
