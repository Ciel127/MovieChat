The next shot cuts to earlier, when the man on the train is talking to others about the content of the newspaper. The next shot cuts to soldiers fleeing back to their barracks. The barracks were full of the wounded and the dead, and the spirits of those who remained were very weak. A soldier lying in a hospital bed gave bread to a new recruit. Finally, the new recruit tied the scarf on his neck and walked resolutely to the front.",
