    "caption": "That was an island. Landing here was dangerous, but the captain still decided to have a try. Finally, with the efforts of the captain and co-pilot, the plane successfully landed on the island. The flight attendant helped everyone leave the plane. The captain told everyone that the plane crashed due to the lightning. Now the power and communication equipment on the plane were destroyed, and everyone's phones had no signal, so they were unable to seek help from the outside world. The captain thought that they were now located on an island in the Philippines. In the aircraft company, many people were holding a meeting to discuss the causes and solutions of this accident.",
