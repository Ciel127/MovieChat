The grass is their eternal home, but they must change their behavior to adapt to the new environment. This cat is too big and too difficult to catch. The lonely cat has no chance to stand up. The whole pride is here. There have been huge changes on the African baking beach. The rain has soaked the beach, and the grass of great life has reappeared, and the river buffalo has come back again. Good times are back. On the African beach, grass is an eternal home, but they must change their behavior to adapt to the new environment. Some animals live here for a year. The grass is soaked, but still growing.

Fresh beaches flow from a distance to the animals. Africa beach grass dry season rainy season survival environmental change.",
