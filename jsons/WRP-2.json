On Friday, three men were chasing and fighting in the woods. One man took a knife and cut another man severely. The knife-wielding man was then chased by a third man. A third man executed the man with the knife. This is when the middle-aged and elderly man in the beginning of the video opens the door and discovers the scene. And shot a third man in the knee. The third man tried to bribe the middle-aged man, but failed. The middle-aged man overpowered the third man.",
