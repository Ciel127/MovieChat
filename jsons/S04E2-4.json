 "caption": "A man stands in front of a surveillance screen, making a phone call, while an elderly woman nearby expresses her displeasure at his actions. It seems to be a government office, but the man is using it for personal matters, which he declines to stop. Another scene shows a man and a woman by a river. The woman seems to be contemplating suicide, and the man is trying to dissuade her. Suddenly, the man feels dizzy and finds himself back in his own home. Someone nearby is mocking him, and he begins to hallucinate. It appears he might have ingested something. The scene shifts, and a red car speeds down the road. Shortly after, the car stops shakily in front of a house.",
