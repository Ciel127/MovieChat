 "caption": "Two men are chatting in a room that looks like a kitchen, but it has been transformed into a place for chemical experiments. Outside, a woman wants to visit them, but she's denied entry. She then leaves while it's still pouring rain. Suddenly, one of the men steps out and calls her back, seemingly wanting her to return. Once inside, she talks with the man about some criminal activities of certain individuals. The man takes the paper from her and meticulously analyzes it. Using the information on the paper, he reconstructs the scenario. Eventually, he realizes someone is tracking him. Turns out, it's his own brother, but he resolutely rejects his brother's actions.",
