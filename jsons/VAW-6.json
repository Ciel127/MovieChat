She was controlled by Jonas and unable to move. In the end, she could only watch as Camellia's father was killed. After arriving home, Camellia asked about her father, Vesper answered that she had not found him. Camellia had no doubts and decided to search with Vesper the next day. Due to Vesper's treatment, Camellia's injury had healed quickly and she was able to walk on her own. Camellia exclaimed about Vesper's advanced biotechnology, and Vesper decided to take her to see her research results.",
