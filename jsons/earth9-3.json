 "caption": "Ocean forests are the largest ecosystems in the ocean, reaching up to three kilometers in length and weighing approximately half a ton. Sharks are the most important food source in ocean forests, but they face challenges due to uneven food distribution. Sharks must use incredible techniques for hunting, including using their tongues to scoop up prey. Only eight people have learned this technique. Sharks face danger as they are trapped in the sea, but luckily, their strength can carry them to deeper waters. Every year, one million sand tiger sharks gather in the deserts of Paris for breeding.",
