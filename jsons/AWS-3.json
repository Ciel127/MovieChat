Their talk escalates into an argument that is interrupted by a hospital staff member rushing in. The next day, the woman from before is learning to paint, accompanied by a lively little girl who brings vivacity and a long-missed smile to the woman's life. Fortuitously, the woman is not alone during her times of sorrow; she is surrounded by the cheerful girl and a loving man who stand by her side to help her through tough times.",
