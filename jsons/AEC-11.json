Passing through the woods, they reach a cliff on a high mountain. It seems they are looking for a creature similar to a pterosaur. Eventually, they find the nest of this creature and attempt to establish a neural connection with it. However, this creature is very temperamental. After a fight and struggle, they eventually succeed. One of the aliens successfully establishes a neural connection with a pterosaur.",
