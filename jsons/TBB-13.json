At the beginning of the video, a man in pink clothing is surrounded and arrested by the police in a gym, appearing to be a villain. A week later, the scene shifts to a thriving amusement park, where a young boy seems to be about to perform on stage, looking very nervous. However, his father gives him tremendous encouragement. The perspective then changes to the parents applying for a loan, and this time it seems they are finally successful. The scene then shifts to the sister in school, where she finally kisses the boy she likes. At the end of the video, the family of five stands in front of their hamburger shop, which has reopened, and everything seems to be flourishing.",
