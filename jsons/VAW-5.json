As a reward, she promised to take Vesper and her father to live in the citadel together in the future. Vesper finally agreed. That night, Vesper's father's illness suddenly worsened, his whole body constantly twitching, and his expression was very painful. Vesper was very anxious, but there was nothing she could do. At this moment, Camellia walked over and gently kissed Vesper's father. He immediately calmed down and fell asleep. The next day, Vesper went to the forest and found Camellia's father in a spaceship. At this point, Jonas also arrived here.",
