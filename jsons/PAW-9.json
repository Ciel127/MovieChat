At this moment, the captain and Gaspare rushed out, controlled these two people, and forced them to tell the passengers' positions. The captain decided to rescue the passengers. Before departure, the captain returned to the plane and wrote some words on a white shirt. If the rescue team saw this information, they could find and help them. At the company, the people finally confirmed the location of the plane crash through satellites. They immediately sent the coordinates to the mercenaries and let them carry out the rescue.",
