 "caption": "Various animals on the beach have formed a unique ecosystem, surviving and reproducing through alliances and cooperation. Birds engage in communal feeding through their tails, forming group feedings. These bird alliances bring benefits and turn into thriving gardens. Indonesia's beaches are the meeting point of different oceans, creating a unique ecosystem. Birds and their benefits, along with smaller creatures like seals, snakes, and abalones, cooperate in hunting. Fish attract the attention of snakes, which capture them. Cooperation leads to higher hunting efficiency. Beautiful butterflies protect themselves by hiding under the sand while helping to clean the sand. Butterflies have strong bites and warning displays to protect themselves and their alliances. The ecosystem of Indonesia's beaches is under threat and needs protection.",
