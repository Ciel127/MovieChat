Ruby found her mother and said she had become friends with Chelsea, the daughter of the Mermaid Queen. Her mother was very angry and had a big argument with Ruby. Afterwards, Ruby returned to the sea again, intending to take out the weapon on her own. And Ruby's mother also back to the sea. She found Ruby's grandmother and told her not to interfere with Ruby's life anymore. However, during the conversation, she learned that the Mermaid Queen had no daughter at all.",
