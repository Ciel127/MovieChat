In the second incident, the woman was chasing the armed robber who had shot her father earlier. The woman caught up with the man, who took out a gun and threatened to keep her away. The woman showed no fear and the man, who attacked her with pepper spray, then fled to a cabin on the edge of the forest. The woman calmed her friend who had been attacked by the man and tied up in the hallway before taking out the knife in the kitchen and preparing to confront the approaching man. The father of the other woman was not shot to death and took out a pistol originally hidden in the tree and decided to fight with the robber man.",
