    "caption": "The video begins with the process of cheetahs hunting antelopes. After they first find their target, they will look and lurk near him to observe his movements. However, the antelope has alerted itself to the danger and quickly flees, and the cheetah's predation plan has failed. Cheetahs end up lying on branches and can't do anything. He then describes the life of a hippopotamus in the water, where they lie together in the water and spit out water from time to time. It then describes the birds fishing on the surface of the water, and they find the right time to dive down and catch the fish. Finally, a scene of a giraffe eating leaves in a high place is described.",
