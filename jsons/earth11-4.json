There are isolated hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor which, due to the presence of specialized bacteria, become a refuge for various organisms. In the deep sea, creatures are on the hunt for food. Some organisms selectively choose what appeals to them, while others move around to find their nourishment. Isolated hydrothermal vents on the seafloor are home to unique bacteria. These vents serve as a sanctuary for marine life. In the Atlantic, there are abundant shrimp populations near these hydrothermal vents. In the western Pacific, there's another series of hydrothermal vents inhabited by different types of bacteria.",
