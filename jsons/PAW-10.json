At this point, the rescue team had boarded the island and found the plane, but they did not see anybody. Fortunately, when they searched on the plane, they discovered the information which was left by the captain and they decided to look for the hostages immediately. However, the Philippine government still refused to provide any military assistance. The captain and Gaspare found the passengers, they killed the prison guards, took the keys from him, and released everyone.",
