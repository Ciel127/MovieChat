 "caption": "The climate creates massive wind and waves, honey-moon fog forms snow fog at high altitudes, and golden-nosed bears live only in China, capable of surviving in cold weather. With the arrival of spring, the forests flourish, and the change in seasons brings a new display, the season of grass. Key points include the formation of huge wind waves due to climate, with honey-moon fog creating snow fog at high altitudes due to cooling. Warm winds from India are blown upwards to form honey-moons, their formation influenced by climatic and geographical factors. Golden-nosed bears are exclusive to China, able to survive in the cold due to their fat, giving them a longevity advantage over other bears. They have their own upper-tier protection and can choose to continue descending to warmer altitudes or return in spring. As spring arrives, trees turn into flowers, and grass becomes lush. Seasonal changes introduce new displays, a grassy season full of small animal life.",
