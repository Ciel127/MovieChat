 "caption": "The episode narrates an investigation into the mysterious events of the Baskerville family, undertaken by two main characters. One of them is frightened and puzzled by a giant hound, experiencing doubt and fear, ultimately unraveling the mystery. Highlights include dialogues and sentiments such as questioning why one only saw the hound for a minute and why it's referred to as 'hound'. Investigations into possible tracks of a giant hound for one's case, struggles with deciphering Morse code, lack of progress regarding information on Louise Mortimer, comedic attempts to lighten the mood with no information on progress, experiences of fear and doubt the previous night that were unparalleled, skepticism despite visual confirmations of a monster, considerations of the information being an acronym, cheerful greetings despite apparent disbelief, a seemingly tan appearance after a vacation, speculation of having another fan, and referencing to a certain 'Mycroft' deploying an agent to surveil, using an alias of 'Greg'. There’s also an indication of familiarity by calling out names, confirmation of identity if there's a willingness to explore, denial of being an agent, advisories against listening to one’s brother, and an inquiry into one's capability and relevance for assistance, without any specific names being used.",
