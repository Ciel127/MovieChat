She told her father the real identity of Camellia and planned to hand her over to Jonas to obtain Jonas' forgiveness, but her father stopped Vesper. In the other room, Camellia raised a knife, intending to end her life, but the knife didn't hit the important part and Camellia only suffered skin injuries. Vesper discovered and stopped her. She told Camellia to find her goals and face life with courage. Afterwards, Vesper treated the wound on Camellia and collected samples from her body. Vesper began studying the genes of Camellia. And Camellia played the piano next to her.",
