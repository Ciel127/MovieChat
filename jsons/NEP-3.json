The video then uses flashbacks and narration to tell us that the woman’s husband went gambling, losing their house, and killed himself. The huge spiritual impact made the woman breakdown. Then, the scene switched to a young man visiting his girl friends’ family, and they have a small talk. After that, they went to a restaurant to have a big dinner, with lots of people invited. However, when they are eating, a group of people break in and started to stir things up.",
