Ewen and other members were also praying in the office, hoping that the mission could proceed smoothly. The body finally drifted to the coast of Spain and was discovered by some fishermen. They handed over the body to the local police. Fortunately, all the documents on the body were intact, and the coroner did not find any problem. According to the regulation, the police would send the remains to the capital and then transferred them to the British Embassy.",
