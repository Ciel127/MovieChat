Then the middle-aged man entered an office. The black man in the office saw the middle-aged man coming and left the office to give him some advice. The middle-aged man and the woman in the office got into some arguments, and finally the two broke up and the man left the office. The man walked out of the office and started talking to another man wearing headphones. The man was so angry that the conversation turned into an argument. Finally the man entered the studio of a radio station and began broadcasting with his former female colleague.",
