The plane was ready to take off, but two separatists drove after it. They held RPGs in their hands and aimed them at the plane. At this moment, Gaspare appeared and shot the two separatists. The plane finally took off. After that, Gaspare took that bag of money and ran into the jungle. The company told captain that the nearest airport is on Siasi Island and he decided to have a try. In the end, with everyone's efforts, the plane successfully landed and all members survived.",
