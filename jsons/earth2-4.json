 "caption": "This video showcases the foothills of Alpbna in Afghanistan. The glaciers and snow here are the most potent deoxygenating forces on Earth, creating massive foothill sculptures. It is also a habitat for wildlife, including snowbirds and wild elephants. 1.5 billion years ago, Alpbna formed on the border of Afghanistan and southern Europe. The foothills of Alpbna are up to 3 meters high, covered with continuous snow. There are numerous moving glaciers here, digging out deep caves. Alpbna foothills are the largest foothill sculptures on Earth, with a distance of more than 43 meters and a height of over 5 meters. This massive foothill sculpture can be seen from space. It's also a habitat for wildlife, including snowbirds and wild elephants. Here, men fight for the right to herd sheep, but a single stumble of a beast can ruin everything. The snowbird is a simple foothill animal, returning to its flock and hosting a one-year-old lamb. During field shooting, this snowbird and her sheepfold were found on a nearby mountaintop. These rugged foothills are void of other wildlife except for dogs, but there's a chance to capture such exquisite wildlife.",
