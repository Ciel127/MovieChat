Started collecting the name tags of the soldiers killed last night. In the muddy ground, he found the glasses of the man wearing glasses the night before, and then he found the body of his good friend, and cried. The video then cuts to a soldier in an office 18 months later, smoking a cigarette and sorting through life tags. Several ministers and soldiers came to a conference room and closed the door, ready to plot something.",
