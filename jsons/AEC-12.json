They joyfully glide through mountain ranges. As they fly low, they come across another alien tribe hunting a large creature with thick skin. They rush over to help, but a sudden crisis occurs. The pterosaurs they are riding seem to encounter a predator more formidable than they have ever faced. This predator pursues them relentlessly. After an intense aerial chase, they finally escape from the clutches of the predator.",
