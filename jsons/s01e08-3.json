 "caption": "A young girl escaped in haste from a castle. In a prison, one man was visiting another man. The visitor held a torch and took a sip of water before passing it to the imprisoned man. Their conversation remained calm, with emotions seemingly held in check.In another location, several people surrounded a body in a snowy, icy landscape. The body had frozen stiff. They discussed something and then departed.Inside a castle, a man who had been observing them earlier received a letter and handed it to another person. In another castle, a young girl was being interrogated by a woman and another man.The sequence of events unfolded with tension and mystery, each scene offering glimpses into a complex narrative. The escape, prison visit, snowy discovery, and castle interrogations were all threads in a story waiting to be unraveled.",
