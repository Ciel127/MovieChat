In the video, they take a super-fast elevator underground to the surface of the Earth, which is covered by a snowstorm. The older brother pulled out the work identification card he had stolen from his grandfather and drove a huge delivery truck. Meanwhile, on the other side, the brother's father, an astronaut, woke up from hibernation to start work on the space station.",
