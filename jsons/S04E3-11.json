 "caption": "A man awakened in a room and immediately made a phone call. On the other end, a little girl was on a plane where everyone, including the pilots, were asleep. She tried to rouse them to no avail, sounding extremely terrified. While they spoke, the man had a sudden realization, promptly ending the call. He then relocated to another location where he video-conferenced with a woman in white. They seemed to have pieced something together. In a flashback, it was revealed that this woman had killed his friend a long time ago, leaving him in immense fear. In a different scene, a man was trapped in a well with water levels rising. He unearthed a skull from the muddy bottom. This revelation led the detective in the house to finally comprehend the truth behind the events.",
