 "caption": "A group of people is riding horses through a forest, with many of the men being shirtless. They appear to be a nomadic tribe, but there are a few well-dressed men and women among them. At this moment, a beautiful woman on a white horse is talking to a man who appears to be kneeling. They continue their conversation as they walk. Then, another man approaches, and he treats the woman very poorly, bullying her. At this point, the people nearby step in to stop him and give the bully a beating. He displays a lot of resentment, seemingly believing himself to be the leader, but the others do not acknowledge him, and the people around him all disapprove. The woman waits for him to give orders. Meanwhile, in a northern location, on top of a castle, two men step out, and they are greeted by a heavy snowfall on the cliff.",
