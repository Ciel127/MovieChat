 "caption": "Inside an aquarium, a woman is surrounded by a group of people, looking cornered and seemingly involved in a crime, displaying evident fear. Eventually, she fires a shot at a man she is conversing with, only for another woman to dive in front, taking the bullet. The woman falls to the ground, causing immense panic among the bystanders. As her husband rushes to her side, efforts to save her prove futile, and she succumbs to her injuries. Following this tragedy, the woman is cremated, and the elderly woman who fired the shot is apprehended. The deceased woman's husband stands silent in front of her tombstone, mourning her loss. The man she saved later seeks a doctor, concerned about his mental well-being after the traumatic event. The scene transitions to his home where he appears extremely agitated.",
