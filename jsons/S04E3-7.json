 "caption": "Two men were in a room, which soon became crowded as another man was brought in, making the total count three. Suddenly, the room's walls turned blood red, and a video of another man started playing, addressing them. Beside the video, a woman issued them a chilling command: they must kill the newly introduced man, or another woman would be brought in and killed instead. The man pleaded with them to end his life, yet none of them could muster the courage to pull the trigger. As the gun was passed around hesitantly, and as one of them finally seemed determined to carry out the act, the man they were supposed to kill began shaking uncontrollably on the floor. The one with the gun hesitated again, unable to follow through. In the end, the trembling man, driven to madness, took the gun and ended his own life. Despite his sacrifice, the puppeteer woman still had the other female killed, leaving the men in the room consumed by rage.",
