    "caption": "The video starts with a man taking a woman to the hospital, where the scars on her wrists suggest she may have attempted suicide. She appears very haggard, but fortunately, her roommate seems quite lively and cheerful. The next part of the video depicts the woman's everyday life in the hospital as she receives treatment, with the man silently supporting her by her side. In the latter half of the video, the woman meets with her aunt and seems to be dissatisfied with her aunt having her confined in a psychiatric facility. She accuses her aunt of only being after money and even uses the threat of death to pressure her. She believes her aunt is annoyed by her and is only interested in her money.",
