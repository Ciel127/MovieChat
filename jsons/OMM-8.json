One letter was about the war, the other was a love letter written by the dead’s fiancéée. The first question was simple. They put the body in a large bottle and then brought the bottle onto the submarine. However, this submarine would depart in two weeks, so they needed to hurry up.Writing letters was quite difficult, Ewen revised many times, but he just couldn’t write a letter that satisfied everyone. Finally, they asked a general to help them and completed this task.",
