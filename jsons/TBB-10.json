There's a peculiar man in pink clothing holding a firearm, seemingly performing some act for the captive audience. This odd man, who also appears to be trapped in the cellar, seems to be devising an escape plan. He mentally rehearses numerous strategies, presenting them to the group. However, his plans don't seem to find favor with the majority. Losing patience, the strange man forcibly herds everyone into a submarine. However, as people scramble into the submarine, a family of five manages to escape in the nick of time.",
