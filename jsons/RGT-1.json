    "caption": "Ruby was born into a family of krakens. She has a father, a mother, and a younger brother. They are all krakens. When Ruby was young, she was told by her parents not to go into the sea. And this has become their family rule. In addition, they live in America, but their appearance is different from that of ordinary people, so they always say they are Canadian. Ruby was about to graduate, and the school had held a prom. But the location of the prom was on a ship in the ocean. Ruby's parents believed that it was too close to the sea, so they did not allow Ruby to participate. Ruby had requested many times, but her parents still didn't agree.",
