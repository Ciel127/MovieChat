They plan to take a spaceship from the warehouse, but their actions disturb the insect species, causing swarms of insects to attack them. In this critical situation, they rise to resist and cooperate closely. Eventually, at the last critical moment, they manage to get through the swarm of insects, reach the spaceship, and successfully fly out of the dilapidated base. In the end, they make an emergency landing on a wasteland and manage to escape safely.",
