The middle-aged man is connected to a crazy man who claims to have a gun and is at the middle-aged man's residence. The middle-aged man tried to dissuade him on the radio, telling him not to hurt his daughter and family. In the conversation, the crazy man's words become more and more intense and angry. The man then threatened the middle-aged man, stood on the roof and jumped. And threatened the rest of the station, pushed him off.",
