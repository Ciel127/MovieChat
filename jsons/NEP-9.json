After a series of chases, hand-to-hand combats, and close-quarter fights in the factory, the police manage to take down most of the criminals. However, the ringleader sneaks away with a bag. The officer chases the main suspect, following him onto a bus. After getting all the passengers to disembark, the two engage in a one-on-one standoff. The officer and the suspect share their life stories and experiences. After understanding the full story, they once again engage in hand-to-hand combat.",
