 "caption": "The Earth's oceans have many deep-sea beaches, accounting for 8% of the world's oceans. These beaches are teeming with life, including some massive creatures. These beaches are crucial for the growth of marine life. However, the majority of marine life on Earth doesn't reside on these beaches but in the waters around Indonesia's Coral Triangle. Deep-sea beaches occupy 8% of the world's oceans, and many life forms exist here, including enormous creatures. These beaches are essential for the growth of marine life, as deep-sea organisms rely on them for their development. However, the largest population of marine life is not found on these beaches but in the Coral Triangle of Indonesia. Here, marine life outnumbers other oceans by tens of times, and it is a haven for Russia's Red Coral.",
