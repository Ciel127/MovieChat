Eventually, through their concerted efforts, they manage to board their own spacecraft and escape from the villain's ship. After their escape, they desperately head towards the surface of a planet to land. During this, the man, in order to ensure the survival of his companions, takes the initiative to go outside the aircraft to support and guide its flight. Fortunately, in the end, they land safely and no one is injured.",
