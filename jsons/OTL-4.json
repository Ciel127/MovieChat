The white-haired middle-aged man connected with a man who had been chased away earlier, and the man said in a telephone connection that he had come to the middle-aged man's residence. At first, the middle-aged man was having a friendly communication with the man, and then the man said that he had a gun and would cause harm to the middle-aged man's family members. The middle-aged man was very anxious and kept communicating with him through words on the radio. Other members of the late-night radio station were also anxious and fearful.",
