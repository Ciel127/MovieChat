In preparation, they go shopping in a restaurant and a supermarket, selecting items for their unborn baby. Later, he visits some of his friends to talk, and then he heads off to work at a car wash. Upon returning home in the evening, the man finds that the elderly person with dementia, who he had taken into his care, is having difficulties, leading to a heated argument. The situation escalates, and he finds himself in a physical altercation with the elderly individual.",
