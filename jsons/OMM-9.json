But the most important was the letter about the war. They folded the letter in half and put it into the envelope. But they only folded the letter once. If someone opened the letter and folded it again, they could discover it through the creases. They also put an eyelash on the letter. If the eyelash disappeared in the end, it can also be the evidence that someone had read the letter. Afterwards, they found a driver and told him to transport the bottle to the submarine.",
