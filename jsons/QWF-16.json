    "caption": "The video tells the story of a male soldier who climbs over a wall to steal food from a farm. The male soldier opened the duck's cage and took out two eggs. As he was about to leave, he saw a little boy from the barn come in. The soldier tried to argue with the boy, but the boy did not answer, immediately closed the door and ran out. The owner of the farm came out with a gun and tried to shoot the soldier. Then, in a constant chase, the two soldiers escaped the farmer's attack. Then in the grass, the soldier found that the two eggs he had stolen had broken, so he had to eat the two eggs on the spot. Another soldier went to the toilet and found that he had been shot during the escape. Then the soldier picked up the wounded soldier and moved on",
