Ruby immediately joined the battle. Three krakens used their eyes to shoot lasers at the trident. Finally, they destroyed the weapon and defeated the mermaid. Everyone saw this battle. They learned that the krakens are not monsters, but friends of humans. After that, Ruby attended the prom as her wish. In the end, Ruby's mother tore up that family rule. From then on, Ruby had become the guardian of the ocean.",
