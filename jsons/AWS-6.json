However, this bliss is short-lived; while they are enjoying time together in a cabin, their parents suddenly burst in, questioning the legitimacy of their relationship and expressing their lack of understanding for their love. Despite the parents' insistence, the couple's determination eventually leads the family to give up trying to separate them. In the end, the parents leave the couple alone, and the man takes the woman away to embark on a happy and ordinary life together.",
