The members said that the plan was proceeding smoothly, and all the details of the dead had been prepared. Now it could be submitted to Prime Minister Churchill for his approval. After receiving the report, Churchill asked the leader for his thought of the plan. In fact, the leader was not optimistic about this plan and didnâ€™t want it to be used in the end. The reason why he currently agreed the plan is to observe Ewen, who he suspected was a Russian spy.",
