The scene then shifts to a woman's bedroom, where she discovers information about a murder. The victim seems to be someone she knows. Subsequently, she heads to her office to warn her close friend about the situation. However, her friend seems to dismiss her concerns. Later that night, as this friend is driving alone on a dark road, a black SUV starts to tail him. In a subsequent scene inside a tunnel, the SUV crashes into his car, leading to his tragic demise.",
