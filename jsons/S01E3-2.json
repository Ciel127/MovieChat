 "caption": "The video revolves around a massive explosion in central London. There are no reports of casualties yet, and authorities can't determine if it's linked to terrorism. The main character, John, and his friend, Sheila, are watching the news when they suddenly receive an emergency call from the police. John and the detective brother of Sheila, whom we'll refer to as the detective, discover that a civil servant recently died on tram tracks, possibly due to some secretive scheme. To prevent the secret from leaking, the detective is compelled to investigate this case. Highlights: John and Sheila receive an urgent call from the police while watching the news; the detective's business seems to be thriving ever since he became \"friends\" with John; Sheila asks the detective how it feels to live at home, and he replies that he's never bored; the detective is summoned to investigate a civil servant's death, suspecting some covert plan; the detective is forced to probe the matter to prevent a leak; John is puzzled at the detective's lies as he hasn't taken any cases recently; the detective's elder brother, Andrew, is investigating an explosion and requests the detective's assistance; the detective discerns the explosion wasn't accidental but rather a deliberate act; he finds out that the victim might've hidden a secretive plan which is now missing; to prevent the leakage of the secret, the detective decides to locate this covert scheme.",
