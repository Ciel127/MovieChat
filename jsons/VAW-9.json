They were Jonas' subordinates, they caught Vesper and made a mark on her hand, representing that Vesper had also become Jonas' servants. After returning home, Vesper felt hopeless, she told Camellia that her father had actually passed away. Camellia was shocked, but didn't believe it, so she asked Vesper to take her to the scene. When Camellia arrived, she lay on her father's body and cried. Vesper wanted to comfort her, but she accidentally found that Camellia was an artificial human. In fact, Camelliaâ€™s father committed a serious crime for creating her, so they were expelled from the citadel. Therefore, Camellia actually had no ability to take Vesper and her father to the citadel. Vesper felt deceived and angry, she hit Camellia. But in the end, Vesper still brought Camellia home.",
