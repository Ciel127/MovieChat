Tension escalates to the point where guns are drawn, creating a very charged atmosphere. In the end, they propose to settle their dispute with a car race. Aside from the two main men, two others also join this racing duel. As the race starts at the judge's signal, the competitors roar off. However, during the race, the man in purple covertly sabotages one of the vehicles, causing it to explode. The bald man stops his car in an attempt to help the victim, while the man in purple crosses the finish line first, securing victory by foul play.",
