Camellia said that she must let her father visit this place, as they had never seen such a creature in the citadel. Returning home, Camellia suddenly asked questions about Vesper's mother. Vesper told Camellia that her mother had become a pilgrim and left them a few years ago. The more Vesper spoke, the sadder she became, and Camellia comforted her constantly. Afterwards, Vesper took out a book from the cabinet, which recorded various animals, including cats, owls, parrots, wolves, etc. Due to the environmental pollution, Vesper had never seen these animals before, then Camellia introduced them to her one by one.",
