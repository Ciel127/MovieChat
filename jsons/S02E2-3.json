 "caption": "Baskerville, a military base, seeks to expel people. The devil bear, a creature, is trapped in a tomb, and monster hunters attempt to capture it. Referred to as The Great Grimpen Minefield, Baskerville has served as a testing ground for over 80 years. The devil bear, repetitively emphasized as being confined in a tomb, becomes a notable entity while a priest blesses him and his beast to emerge from hell. Thus, the essence intertwines the military base, a monstrous bear, and spectral elements into a peculiar narrative.",
