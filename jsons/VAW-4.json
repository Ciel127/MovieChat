After returning home, Vesper's father asked where she got the seeds, and Vesper told him that the seeds were stolen. Her father was very angry and commanded Vesper to return the seeds. But Vesper disagreed, and argued with her father. After that, Vesper left home and ran into the forest. In the forest, Vesper found another girl who was attacked by a tree. She was seriously injured and unconscious. Vesper took the girl home and treated her wounds.",
