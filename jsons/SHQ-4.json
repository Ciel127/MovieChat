On one screen, there was a lot of information of the guard, it showed the events that the guard had participated in. Charlie's classmates believed that Charlie's father was the guard. But Charlie thought his father was just the housekeeper. A child hit a button and a car ran out. In the car, there were many Charlie's photos and articles. Charlie finally believed his classmates' words. At the same time, a company was also searching for the guard. Fortunately, the guard always protected himself well and he has never been found.",
