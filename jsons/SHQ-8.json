However, while the boss was checking downstairs, he was caught by the children using high-tech weapons. They tied the boss on a chair and asked him questions. The boss said he wanted to get the energy ball to help the world, but the children didn't believe him. Afterwards, they wanted to exchange the boss for their friends. During the hostage exchange, the boss suddenly snatched the energy ball from Charlie's hand and ordered his subordinates to catch all the children together.",
