Then the car followed the middle-aged man's car. He found the middle-aged man driving to a cabin in the woods. The next scene in the video shows guards escorting the prisoner out of the prison after he had earlier been wounded in the knee. He communicated with the man who had been cut with the knife and expressed disappointment at the man's mistake.",
