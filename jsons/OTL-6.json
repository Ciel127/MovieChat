The presenter was threatened to stand on the rooftop by the man, who asked his friend to push him off. In the end, the host did not choose to jump off the roof, but continued to advise the man. After being threatened by the man, they realized that they were not safe. The group then took the elevator to the first floor and found that one of the original guards had been killed. The host had to continue communicating with the man.",
