    "caption": "The video opens with a family of three—a man, a woman, and an elderly person—sitting at a table, enjoying snacks together. The man and woman then go for a walk outside, where they express their love for each other amidst the blowing wind. The narrative quickly moves to the next day, when the woman wakes up to find the man lying unconscious in a room, apparently having triggered some illness. That evening, as the man is cutting his elderly father's hair and giving him a bath, a sudden and unexpected event occurs. The man seems to be confronted with something deeply frightening from his memories, which sends him into a frenzy. Paralyzed with fear, he lays on the floor motionless, while his father appears to be disoriented. When the man finally snaps out of his bewildered state, he discovers that his father has taken his own life",
