The man continues talking, and then the perspective shifts to a clock tower.In the clock tower, a girl lies on a pile of hay, being scolded by another young man, but she refuses to comply and resists. This escalates into a heated argument until an elderly person arrives, putting an end to their dispute.On top of a castle, with heavy snowfall outside, two men are gazing out. They see a horse approaching, but there is no rider on it. It appears its owner has died. The horse enters the town with a saddle on. These two men immediately report this development.",
