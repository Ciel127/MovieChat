Then he saw that the enemy soldier was struggling to breathe, and tried to get up to stifle his mouth. The soldier then took out a branch and raised his helmet high above his head, only to be hit by enemy bullets once it was exposed. Then the man saw that the enemy soldier was still alive and struggling for his life. The man seems to have agreed to the request of the enemy soldier before his death, and picked up some water in the pool to feed the dying enemy soldier. Then the enemy soldier died a painful death, and the man was desperate on the battlefield full of battlefield wounds.",
