One of them, a blind soldier, took out a knife and stabbed himself, hoping to kill himself. Several other soldiers rushed to stop. After the encounter, the two soldiers argued again, and finally one of them was very tired and fell into a deep sleep. The final shot cuts to an office where many officers are saluting as they prepare to begin a meeting.",
