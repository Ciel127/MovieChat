 "caption": "During summer, Angel Island experiences erratic weather conditions, wherein the mother of the antlion imparts survival techniques to her offspring. As Angel Island undergoes soaring temperatures in the summer, the antlion matriarch educates her young ones on survival strategies. The skills and expertise of the mother are paramount for the children. These young ones rely on their mother for sustenance. Without the maternal presence, they would be unable to survive the winter. The antlion mother is characterized by solitude and secrecy. As the mother of a family with four offspring, she plays a crucial role in their growth and learning, ensuring they can fend for themselves in the future. Summer stands as an invaluable period for the mother to impart these survival lessons to her offspring, a time when they undergo growth and learning. The mother's territory is rich in both food and water resources. Yet, despite her nurturing role, the antlion mother faces challenges like the fierce winds accompanied by thunder, rendering the hillsides devoid of life. To the north, she confronts other looming dangers as well.",
