 "caption": "A woman walked in, seemingly oblivious to everything happening around her. The man nearby appeared both shocked and confused because he remembered meeting her by the river, and they should recognize each other. Overwhelmed by anger, he pointed at her and attempted to draw a knife to harm her. Just then, the scene shifted to another room where the would-be victim was publicly recounting the incident, his demeanor a mixture of horror and panic. The man who had tried to attack with the knife was pinned down, receiving a beating before being taken to a hospital. After this ordeal, he returned home with his associate. Another man dressed in black approached them for a chat. Their expressions were filled with concern, and it seemed they didn't believe the events that unfolded were real. They were desperately seeking a solution or trying to understand what had transpired.",
