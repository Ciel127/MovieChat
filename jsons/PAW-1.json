After boarding the plane, he greeted the co-pilot and all the flight attendants. A staff member told him that the plane would encounter bad weather. The captain didn't think too much, he was experienced and believed there wouldn't be any problems. At this moment, a police officer arrived and told Torrance that he needed to escort a prisoner on the plane. Although he was unwilling, he had no choice and told them to sit away from the passengers.",
