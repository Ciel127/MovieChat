 "caption": "This video showcases the survival strategies of animals in the extreme frozen worlds of both the Antarctic and the Arctic during the winter. Penguins in the Antarctic protect precious heat by forming tight groups, while ducks in the Arctic use open water beneath the ice to find food. Additionally, large Arctic animals like muskoxen can open pathways through the ice to locate food.Penguins in the Antarctic protect precious heat by forming tight groups. Ducks in the Arctic find food in open water beneath the ice. Muskoxen in the Arctic can open pathways through the ice to locate food. The Antarctic experiences extremely cold winters with temperatures dropping to minus 60 degrees. The Arctic is a frozen ocean surrounded by land, and its winters are also extremely cold. Ducks must quickly feed during brief periods of tidal retreat. Muskoxen use their strength to open the ice and find plant food.",
