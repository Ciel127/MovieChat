Under their threat, he is forced to drive to an abandoned factory. However, on the way, his son-in-law arrives and realizes the peril his father-in-law is in. Pretending to be unaware of the situation, the son-in-law decides to accompany the middle-aged man to the factory. Once there, the gang realizes that the son-in-law is actually a police officer and they immediately open fire. However, they fail to kill him and the officer bravely engages them in combat.",
