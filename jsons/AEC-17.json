It seems their home has been burned down, and their families have been killed. Left with no choice, they begin to migrate away from their homeland that has been engulfed by fire. The scene then shifts to a human laboratory. A group of people are trying to escape from this lab. They board an aircraft, and under the cover of night, they depart from the human base. These are kind-hearted humans. They head towards the alien's residence, seemingly wanting to help the aliens escape the cruelty of their fellow humans.",
