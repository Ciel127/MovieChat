 "caption": "The video showcases the ecological changes in the Alatak region after the ice and sand. It highlights the lifestyles of sea lions and Alatak lions and their adaptability to the environment. Sea lions and Alatak lions in the Alatak region have adapted to life in high places, with strong flying and swimming abilities. Alatak lions use air sacs to protect their chickens. In the Alatak region, there is sunlight 24 hours a day during the summer, and animals adapt their schedules accordingly. Alatak lions kill any carriers, including a large number of vegetables. Male iceberg lions have disappeared, and females are trapped in the soil. Males can take females to the seaside to find food while maintaining their swimming abilities. Sea lions have recently started living by the sea but cannot return to the land. Sea lions use their massive front legs to withstand the waves. Sea lions maintain a swimming position in deep sand areas but cannot swim unintentionally.",
