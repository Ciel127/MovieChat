At the same time, in a room, several people were anxiously waiting for a reply. Time had returned to six months earlier. Ewen was a lawyer and he was attending a banquet to celebrate his retirement. His brother was also at the scene. However, his brother felt very strange because Ewen had never dealt with any case in the past three months. His brother believed that Ewen had participated in some secret missions so he had to declare his retirement to the public.",
