Obviously, if these photos were used, the German army would immediately discover the problem in the photos and see through this trick. The only way was to find someone in this city who was similar to the dead. One night in the bar, several people were discussing the details of the mission. Suddenly, they discovered a person who looked very similar to the dead. They immediately stopped him, chatted with him, and took photos of him.",
