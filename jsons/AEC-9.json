    "caption": "The video starts with a group of tall blue extraterrestrials who seem to be practicing horse riding outdoors. The camera then shifts to a human-built campsite where staff in a laboratory are examining the planet's surface on virtual screens. After their observations, they board a helicopter to survey the planet's surface directly. They land on a cliff surrounded by floating islands, creating a spectacular and unique landscape. They then proceed to a temporary research hut, planning to continue their on-site exploration. The scene switches back to the aliens, who now not only have mastered horse riding but also seem to be riding creatures resembling pterosaurs.",
