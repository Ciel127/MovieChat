Chelsea said that since the disappearance of the Trident, all the mermaids have been hiding because they cannot defeat the krakens without the power of the weapon. But she couldn't bear the life of hiding, so she escaped. Ruby also hoped to live an ordinary life. Finally, they came up with a solution: as long as they found the Trident, they could avoid the war and make the two families live peacefully.",
