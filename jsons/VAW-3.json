At this moment, Jonas walked out of the room and handed a knife to one of the children, telling him to end the woman's life. The boy refused at first, but under the pressure of the people around him, he still killed her. Jonas brought Vesper into the house and Vesper explained her intention. Jonas told her if she wanted bacteria, she had to exchange them with blood. For the sake of her father's life, Vesper can only agree. But when Vesper finished drawing blood, Jonas didn't want to give her the bacteria and drove Vesper out of the house.",
