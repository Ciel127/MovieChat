In the middle of the video, another woman and a man discuss the woman's condition in a restaurant and offer her full support for her treatment. In the next scene, the woman and the man are driving somewhere else. Their conversations and actions lead them to run into an animal and have a car accident. The next part of the video shows the scene one year later. A man walks into a grocery store and has a friendly conversation with the owner. The shopkeeper showed the man something and then gave him a set of keys. The man makes eye contact with the animal on the wall.",
