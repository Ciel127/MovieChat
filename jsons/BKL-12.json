He then shuts off the electricity and appears to be waiting for something or someone. Soon after, a group armed with guns invades his house. The man also retrieves a gun, and a fierce gunfight ensues. Throughout the battle, the man finds himself in perilous situations several times but always manages to turn the tide in his favor. After the prolonged shootout, the man turns the electricity back on, connecting it to the water he had laid out earlier, electrocuting all the intruders who were standing in it. The following day, still shaken, the man is in a hotel. When a waiter delivers his breakfast, the man impulsively points his gun at the server, frightening him so much that he drops the breakfast.",
