He threatened the group member with a gun and asked if the content of the letter was true. The group member was afraid and told him the secret of this mission. Soon everyone knew this news. If that man was a German spy, then everything was over. But if what the man said was true, there was indeed an anti-Nazi alliance, then they could cooperate with the organization and continued the mission.",
