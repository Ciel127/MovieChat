 "caption": "The story of this episode takes place in a city called Agra, where an event named Tabris occurred during a team's search for a memory pen. One of the team members had been killed, leading the team to stop using the Freedom Ship. However, a lady plans to help the team find the memory pen and solve the issue. She also promises to assist a woman, but she's unsure if she can save her forever. In the end, the lady tells two gentlemen she plans to leave but assures them she will return. Agra being a nickname, which is good news for the speaker; the deceased team member searching for the woman and being part of the team; the woman's difficulty in aging as they often retire; a sentiment that one shouldn't blame the speaker for leaving as voices can be heard; a plane failure where nothing happened; her assurance of returning but it being meaningless; every action being random with even the famous detective unable to predict the action of scissors; the lady's intention to help the team retrieve the memory pen and solve their problem; her promise to assist the woman without certainty of permanent rescue; and her informing the two gentlemen about her departure with a promise to return.",
