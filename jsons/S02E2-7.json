 "caption": "In the beginning, one individual felt he had been nervous for a while, but another thought he had just made himself nervous. Subsequently, the latter began his deduction from a leaping logic, analyzing the relationship between a man in a suit and his mother, as well as their pet dog. In the end, the first individual discovered that the other's deductions were correct. Some highlights include: The deducing individual believes that the first person just made himself nervous, and by analyzing the man’s clothing, the mother’s jewelry, and their pet dog, he drew conclusions. The man wanted to impress his mother, the mother had a late husband, and the dog's name was Whiskey. The deductive reasoner arrived at the conclusions by observing and analyzing, without cheating, and eventually, the former acknowledged the latter’s deductions. The first man hoped the other would listen to him, referred to himself as the friend of the latter, which was denied, and ultimately, found out that the latter’s deductions were accurate",
