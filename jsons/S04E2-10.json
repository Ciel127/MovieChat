 "caption": "In a room, two men and a woman were watching a television. On the screen was a woman, and one of the men became extremely agitated upon seeing her. He urged the other man to leave immediately, but the woman, who appeared to be the landlady, didn't force him out. The two of them together watched a message left by the woman on the screen. It seemed she had passed away, and this was her final message. In a hospital room, a frail man lay in bed with a portly man mockingly looking at him, attempting to provoke him. However, the frail man remained indifferent, showing no emotion, looking utterly exhausted.",
