There are also birds foraging on the water, sticking their mouths into the water in search of food. The giant lizards in the grass are also among the formidable predators here, watching their prey with great eyes. And those birds are still drinking safely in the water. The scene of elephants bathing in the water is then described, which is the best way to end a good day.",
