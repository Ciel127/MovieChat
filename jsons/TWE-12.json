    "caption": "The video follows humans building huge propulsion engines on the Earth's surface in an attempt to push the planet out of the solar system and find new places to settle. However, during the voyage, it was attracted by Jupiter's gravity and gradually moved closer to Jupiter and was about to collide. Artificial intelligence developed by humans on Earth broadcasts to the entire planet and advises humans to give up hope as soon as possible and reunite with friends and relatives at the last minute. As the main characters, the brother and sister think that they can use the space station to ignite the gravitational chain between Jupiter and Earth and free the Earth from gravity.",
