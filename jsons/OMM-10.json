However, at this point, to stop the mission was impossible. Ewen told her that the country gave him an important mission and he would become a hero. But the woman didn't believe him. She knew that she couldn't see the body and left the room disappointed. After they put the body on the submarine, one member said that he wanted to stay to express his respect for the dead. Although this was not in the plan, Ewen also agreed.",
