For the sake of his country, Ewen finally sent away his wife and children to America. Churchill was discussing the war plan with the officers. In order to increased their chances of winning, they needed to occupy Sicily. However, there were a large number of Nazi soldiers on there, so it was difficult to occupy the island. They needed to find a way to deceive the Germans and let them transfer some of the soldiers on the island.",
