He needed to be a male, appropriate age, sound limbs, etc. In the end, they found an eligible body in a hospital, who was a tramp before his death. When the Germans discovered this body, they would definitely conduct a careful investigation on him. Therefore, they needed to give this tramp a new name, gave him a new identity, took photos of him, and fabricated his life story. The most important thing was to find him a lover. In the end, they chose a woman in the Twenty Committee. And the woman's request was to participate in this action.",
