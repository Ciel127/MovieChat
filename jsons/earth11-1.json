 "caption": "The majority of Earth's surface is covered by oceans, but most of these oceans remain inaccessible to humans. Marine life constantly roams in search of food. One of the top predators in the ocean is the whale shark, which periodically ventures to the surface waters to feed. Despite their massive size, whale sharks rely on tiny marine plankton for sustenance. Other predatory fish also gather here to feed, but they must always be on the lookout for the presence of whale sharks. Predators in the ocean must seize opportunities quickly, as such scenes do not last long. Under perfect water conditions, many predators continually search throughout the ocean.",
