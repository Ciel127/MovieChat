 "caption": "The journey of mosquitoes in search of food is filled with challenges and difficulties, but they do not give up. Their journey spans nearly 2,000 kilometers as they constantly search for food to survive. The challenges mosquitoes face in their quest for food include the seasonality and scarcity of food sources. They may search for days without finding any evidence of food. Despite traveling 30 kilometers a day, covering almost 2,000 kilometers, mosquitoes do not stop their journey even when they find food, as they continue to search for new grasslands. Other animals also face food-related issues, such as wolves sometimes not having enough to eat and seven hungry pigs in need of food. Mosquitoes food journey challenges seasonality scarcity sources animals wolves pigs.",
