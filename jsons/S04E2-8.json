 "caption": "A slightly short and chubby man leads two other men dressed in black down a corridor. They then enter a room which appears to be inside a hospital. The shorter man provocatively taunts the other two, who show clear signs of anger but seem powerless to react. The setting appears to be a morgue, and the taunting man seems to be a doctor from that place. The man in black is accusing the doctor of something and calls over a woman for verification. However, the woman seems utterly clueless, expressing great shock. The man in black is baffled, lost in deep thought, unable to comprehend why the woman doesn't recognize him.",
