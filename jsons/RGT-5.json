Through conversation, she learned that in their family, only women who encounter seawater will become the kraken, and she also had a grandmother who lived in the ocean. Ruby was curious about the underwater world and decided to search for her grandmother. She jumped into the sea and became a kraken. She was excited and explored everywhere. With her uncle's guidance, she finally arrived at the krakenâ€™s kingdom. It was a large castle. Ruby met her grandmother and many other krakens in it. In fact, her grandmother was the queen of the krakens and She hoped Ruby could become her inheritor.",
