Everyone could only wait. Finally, the documents of the dead were sent back. The seal on the letter didnâ€™t change, which mean it had not been opened. Everyone felt very disappointed. However, one person said that even without opening the envelope, there was still a way to took out the letter. Therefore, they opened the envelope and continued to check. They found that the eyelash was missing and the letter had been folded one more time. That is to say, the German spy had already read the letter and the mission was successful.",
