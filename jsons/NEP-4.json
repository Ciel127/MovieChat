The leader of the people standing started to talk something, trying to persuade the diner of cooperating. However, talking seemed to be useless, so they tried to use force to threaten diners. They hit and punch those who refused to listen. The security staff tried to keep order, but they were defeated by people standing. Finally, a young man came and called police, scared those people away. The police station paid attention to this issue. However, later on, this group still walks around, gathering damnatory evidence of other people and use this to threaten them.",
