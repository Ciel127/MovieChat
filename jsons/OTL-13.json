The terrorists dropped the detonator, but there was no intended explosion. All the previous cast members came to the studio to celebrate and inform the new man that the terrorist attack was all set up to trick him. The new man felt dizzy, couldn't accept the fact, lost his footing and fell down the steps. The crowd panicked and found that he had no vital signs. This caused the senior man who planned the party to fall into a deep remorse. However, on the second day when the man boarded the car, he found the new man sitting in the driver's seat and greeted him. It turns out that the death of the new man is also prepared for the prank of the older man.",
