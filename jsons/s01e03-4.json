 "caption": "This is a wonderful epic series clip. The background of it is in middle age. In a room, two men and a woman are engaged in conversation. The woman hands a small knife to one of the men, who examines it closely and then feigns ignorance. At that moment, the other man approaches and says something to the woman. She listens attentively, and the man eventually reveals something very important. The scene then shifts to a training ground where several groups of people are training. A newcomer is assigned to train with some veteran soldiers but quickly emerges victorious. Afterward, in the dining area, he is surrounded by a group of veterans who start teasing him. However, the man refrains from resisting, considering discipline. At that moment, another shorter man enters and intervenes, putting a stop to the teasing. ",
