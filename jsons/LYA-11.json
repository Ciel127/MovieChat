The scene then shifts to another location where an antagonist with graying hair has imprisoned the protagonist, intent on executing his subsequent plan. After the villain leaves, the protagonist manages to unlock his handcuffs and tries to escape undetected. However, during his escape, he is caught by the villain's mech, and at the same time, the villain's mech army is also pursuing his companions. With no other choice, the protagonist engages in an intense fight with the villain, involving a fierce gun battle, while his companions are also looking for a way to escape.",
