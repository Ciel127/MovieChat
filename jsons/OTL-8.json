The men followed the terrorists' tips through a number of rooms, and they found that the rooms had been tampered with by the terrorists. Posters of men as hosts were vandalized by random drawings of terrorists. The man and his companions walked through the office area to a utility room, where they opened a closet and, on instructions from the terrorists, took out a doll. The man then removed the surveillance camera and went into a plumbing room.",
