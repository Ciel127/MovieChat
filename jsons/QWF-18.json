    "caption": "At the beginning of the video, two soldiers in the trenches take out a collection of liquor and start sharing it. Then they realized that the enemy soldiers were approaching the trench. The main character in the video is a recruit in the camp who rushes into a trench, tackles the drinking enemy soldier, wrestles him down in the mud and tries to suffocate him to death. He then fell to the ground, and another enemy soldier saw the pistol on the ground and picked it up and tried to kill him. He fought with enemy soldiers and fell into a hole in the ground, and when the recruits confronted the enemy soldiers, the recruits were stabbed in the back. The enemy, seeing that his heart had been pierced, also gave up the idea of shooting him and left.",
