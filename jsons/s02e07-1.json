 "caption": "It begins with a map, a vast one that requires switching perspectives to see its entirety. The map features mountains, castles, and rivers. Among them, the castles are continuously expanding, and the trees on the map are growing. These castles and trees appear to be meticulously crafted, resembling intricate blocks.Next, we arrive at a castle, where a young man is interrogating a group of people who seem to have done something wrong. The young man proceeds to physically assault them, and the individuals cower on the ground, unable to resist. The young man, accompanied by some others, rides away on horseback. They then arrive at a mountain where the sun is rising high. A man and a woman embrace on the ground. The man wakes up and helps the woman to her feet.",
