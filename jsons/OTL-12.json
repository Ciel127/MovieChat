After a while, a police officer rushed in and was threatened by the terrorists with guns and bombs, and had to help the man put on an explosive vest. The police tried to gently persuade the terrorist after putting on a vest for the new man, but the terrorist shot him dead. The terrorist then threw the detonator on the ground. Everyone was panicking. But instead of an explosion, everyone laughed except the new man. It turns out that all this is the entire television staff in order to prank the new man planned a show. All the actors who had been killed were here for the party.",
