 "caption": "In the video, the protagonist is chosen to be the best man at the wedding of two individuals, surprising him greatly, yet he eventually agrees. He maintains a very cool and rational attitude towards the wedding and emotions but also expresses gratitude and appreciation towards his friend. Despite viewing weddings as a celebration of falsehood and emotion, he decides to participate, acknowledging that his friend makes him more brilliant in adventures and holds a special place for him. The protagonist believes that weddings and marriage are an insult to human morality, and although he will give a speech at the wedding, he cannot congratulate his friend. He observes that brides typically choose plain-looking bridesmaids, drawing a parallel to his relationship with his friend, and considers his wisdom and acuity to be accentuated by contrasting with his friend.",
