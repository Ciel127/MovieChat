If there was a radio in the house, they could seek help from the outside world. But he needed a helper, finally, he chose the criminal, he untied the criminal's handcuffs and let him go to the jungle together. In fact, this island was controlled by the separatists of the Philippines. Last night, they saw the plane crashed on the island, and now they were searching for the plane. In the jungle, the captain and the criminal started chatting. The criminal's name was Gaspare, and in fact, he was a soldier. It was a misunderstanding that he was treated as a criminal.
