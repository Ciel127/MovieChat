 "caption": "When the doctor learns of the detective's faked death and subsequent return, he experiences a mixture of shock and anger. The detective elucidates his plan of feigning death, revealing it was a necessity to thwart the villain. His sibling and a select few trusted allies were privy to this plan. The key points include the doctorâ€™s shock and anger towards the detective's faux death strategy, the detective elaborating that his counterfeit demise was to stymie the antagonist, and the secretive nature of the plan, shared only with his brother and a handful of trusted individuals. The detective, having considered 13 scenarios, eventually opted for a feigned death, with a certain woman and a few assistants also being aware of the plan. The doctor holds the belief that the detective should have provided at least a word to confirm his ongoing existence, whereas the detective was reluctant to allow anyone to be privy to his continued existence. Accusations of deceit come from the doctor, resulting in a fiery dispute between the two, culminating in the detective finally deciding to inform the doctor that he remains alive.",
