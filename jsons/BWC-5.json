It then describes lions resting in groups under trees. Dingio, also powerful predators, are hovering near the zebra's territorial range, but after the zebra discovers, they use their numerical superiority to drive the wild dog and defend their territory. Wild dogs have no harvest and can only return empty-handed.",
