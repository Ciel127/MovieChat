The protagonist and his friend also encounter an acquaintance. Ultimately, they discover that the decoding task was to prevent a missile from being stolen. The protagonist and his friend receive a 12-hour ultimatum from the kidnapper to solve a puzzle or risk the woman's life; the kidnapper's primary motive seems to challenge the protagonist; even after solving the puzzle, the protagonist doesn't find the woman; they meet someone known to the protagonist; they determine that the decoding was to stop a missile theft; the acquaintance knows the protagonist because they worked at the same company; the kidnapper's demand might be to get the protagonist to decode and prevent the missile theft; they realize the woman isn't the kidnapper's primary concern; they deduce the kidnapper might want the protagonist for the decoding task; they ascertain the motive might be to stop the missile from being stolen.",
