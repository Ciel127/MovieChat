After the crash, the crew members disembark from the ship and start looking for a way to ascend again, gradually establishing a launch base in the vicinity. The latter half of the video tells the story of the protagonist continuously trying to pilot a spacecraft to take off from the planet's surface. Eventually, he succeeds. He successfully takes off and flies around the sun.",
