Charlie's father, Jack, decided to drive to the scene and check the situation. While driving, he met another person. That man said he was from the US Air Force, and he was also looking for that object, so they drove together to the forest. In the end, they found an UFO. When they approached, a ball flew out of the spaceship. The ball observed the two people and ultimately chose Jack, it stopped on his hand. Then, the spaceship exploded.",
