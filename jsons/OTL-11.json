One man held a knife to the terrorist's throat and another aimed a gun at him, but the terrorist said the explosion would continue even if he was killed. The two men despaired of the situation and laid down their weapons. The terrorist then came up with an even crazier idea and threatened the two men to carry out his idea for him.",
