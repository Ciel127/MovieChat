    "caption": "The video shows robbers holding a woman hostage in the woods and threatening her father. The old father took out a pistol to confront the robber through some schemes to gain the opportunity for himself. The old father and the man reached an agreement and let go of the woman, both of whom confronted each other with pistols. The man asked the old man to drop the gun, which he did. The man then shot the old man and fled through the woods. Seeing this, the woman began to chase the man in the forest. And dug up a stash of pepper spray in the woods. The next scene shows that the old man is not killed after being shot by the man, but is wounded and hides in a tree hole.",
