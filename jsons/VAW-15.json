She had always been curious about the behavior of the pilgrims, so she followed her. After walking for several days, they finally arrived at their destination. There were many pilgrims here. Behind them, there was a tower. Vesper climbed up the tower and saw the scenery she had never seen before, including the citadel. She took out the seeds and put them on her hand. A gust of wind blew by, the seeds floated, and finally disappeared in the air.",
