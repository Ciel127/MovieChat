Late at night, the man sits on the couch, chatting with his young daughter, looking rather preoccupied. The next day, he contacts a woman and arranges to meet her at a restaurant. After an extensive conversation in the restaurant that appears to last quite some time, the man seems to have an epiphany. He then sets out to search for an older man with white hair. In the end, he finds him in a garden.",
