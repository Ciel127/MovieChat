 "caption": "The video showcases the perilous life of a flock of lambs flying on the peak of Mount Digamur on Earth, and the cooperation and competition between golden eagles and these lambs. Despite over half a million birds passing this peak annually, many lose their lives. For these birds, it's a challenging migratory journey, yet they press on fearlessly. Highlights include the cooperation and competition between golden eagles and lambs; golden eagles help lambs separate and escape from the siege of other birds and also compete with other birds for food and territory, leading to avian fatalities. Mount Digamur is treacherous; over half a million birds pass this peak each year, and many perish, yet they persist fearlessly on this challenging migratory journey. Mount Digamur is often referred to as the peak that no bird can fly over. Concerning its altitude, it stands about 500 meters above sea level. For most, this is their first and last human journey, with only a few successfully reaching the summit, staying for mere minutes. Golden eagles await, collaborating with birds to help them break from their flock, competing for food and territory, and contending with recuperating weather and competition at high altitudes. The birds' perseverance shines as they face numerous challenges and dangers, overcoming the highest barriers and ultimately completing their migratory journey.",
