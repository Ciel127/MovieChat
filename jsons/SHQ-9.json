At this moment, Jack, who was on a mission outside, learned that his house had been invaded. He immediately terminated the mission and returned, intending to rescue the children. In the secret headquarters, the children and the team were in a fierce battle. Although the child used the weapons in the room, they still couldnâ€™t beat the team because they had too many members. At the last moment, they threw the ball into the portal and then destroyed the portal.",
