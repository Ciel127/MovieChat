 "caption": "A man in a shirt is angry at another man due to some issues. The latter mocks the former, leaving the angry man feeling powerless. The next day, the disgruntled man visits the two men, and they sit down to chat. They seem to be family, but their expressions are far from happy. They are both very angry, and as they argue, they gradually uncover the truth behind their conflict. Their memories take them to a grassy field with some tombstones. A young boy is seen playing joyfully with a ship's knife and a pirate hat; this appears to be a memory of their childhood.",
