The scene then shifts to another location where a man with a bun seems to be tying two dead bodies to chairs, revealing his twisted plan to them. Next, the scene moves to a rest stop in the desert, where a burly man accompanied by a child arrives. After a brief pause, they change into casual clothes and forge identification documents. They then enter an airport, disguising themselves as tourists.",
