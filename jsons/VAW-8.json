Jonas dismantled the robot and said he had to repair it. He asked Vesper if she knew about the stolen seeds. Vesper was frightened, but she quickly calmed down and said she didn't know. Then Jonas asked her why she was here, and Vesper said she was here to get the bacteria which was exchanged by the blood. However, Jonas still didn't plan to give it to her. Afterwards, while Jonas was not paying attention, Vesper picked up the robot and ran away.In the forest, Vesper checked the condition of the robot. In fact, Jonas did not repair the robot at all, but destroyed it. The robot can't fly and can't speak right now.",
