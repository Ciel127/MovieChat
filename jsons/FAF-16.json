It appears that a villain is chasing two protagonists, and in a selfless act to allow the other protagonist to escape, one hero bravely sacrifices himself to clear the path. Despite their efforts, the antagonist calls in a helicopter for backup, intending to use a grappling hook to latch onto the protagonists' car. However, the protagonist's vehicle, being modified, suddenly accelerates and manages to bring down the villain's two helicopters in a heart-stopping moment. The villain loses consciousness amidst the intense explosions.",
