 "caption": "The video narrates the scene of Wu Lu Chang Diao waiting on the beach for food to drop, and other organisms within the beach ecosystem. Fishing for Wu Lu Chang Diao involves safeguarding injured Wu Lu Chang Diao and swiftly removing fishbones. Wu Lu Chang Diao is one of 650 fish species in Pan Sen Bay, with a vast number of fish sustaining a large population of water birds. Bangkok, Hong Pond, and Bru Lla River combine to form the world's largest beach. Each year, nearly 20 million tons of sand from the South Sea flow onto the beach. Butterflies have carved a unique ecological niche on the beach, with butterflies feeding on other butterflies, specialized to Bangkok's environment. In Indonesia, these butterflies have formed a distinctive ecosystem. The beach also serves as a relaxation playground for the youth, with some even indulging in swimming, staying on the beach for over 30 seconds. Other organisms in the beach ecosystem include Ling Xiang, Yun Chong, and Nuan Ge Bi.",
