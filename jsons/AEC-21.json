Humans, in their armored vehicles and aircraft, unleash firepower upon the alien, who fight back with fierce determination, using bows and mounted creatures. Despite their technological disadvantage, the alien's connection to their planet's wildlife turns the battle. Massive creatures native to Pandora join the fray, breaking through the human lines. This display of unity with their environment underscores the alien's resilience and hints at a deeper bond with their world, shifting the balance of the conflict.",
