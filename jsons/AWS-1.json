On the other side, a girl finishes her day at work, greets her best friend, and returns home to join the boy in taking care of their small but cozy home. They seem to be setting up their new home. The latter half of the video shifts into a more metaphorical portrayal with black and white imagery. The man walks into the mist, heading toward the beach. Then, a year later, it is the woman who emerges from the fog.",
