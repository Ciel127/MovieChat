 "caption": "The video begins with a map that showcases castles and trees. These structures are continually expanding and growing, but there seems to be an issue with the old castles on the map.Next, we find ourselves in a campsite at night, where visibility is extremely limited. Two people are engaged in conversation, discussing various matters. Suddenly, one of them departs, and in an unexpected turn of events, the departing person violently kills the other person who had been engaged in conversation earlier. The expression on the victim's face shows surprise and attention.Further into the scene, several lifeless bodies are scattered on the ground, indicating a battlefield. These casualties seem to have occurred during a conflict. Amidst this grim scene, a doctor is attending to a wounded soldier in the harsh, snowy conditions, providing some semblance of care and hope.",
