 "caption": "Two men held wine glasses and silently stared at each other by a stream in a woodland. Meanwhile, some children were washing their pots and pans in the creek, chatting as they worked. One girl, dressed as a boy, appeared to be in a bad mood and got into an argument with a nearby man. They were engaged in a heated dispute. The girl suddenly said something that seemed to surprise the man greatly. His attitude towards her improved, and they continued to talk while organizing their belongings. They appeared to be getting ready to depart for another location, possibly a port.At the port, a man, seemingly arrogant, approached some fishermen and communicated something to them. The fishermen then pointed him in a direction. The man and a woman rented a horse and rode along the coastline.",
