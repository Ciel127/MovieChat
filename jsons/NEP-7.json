However, one of the criminals, disguised as a doctor, enters a patient's room with intentions to kill them. An undercover cop discovers him just in time, and after a chase and a fight, the criminal is subdued and successfully apprehended. The scene then shifts to another location where a gang of criminals in a rundown house seems to be waiting for news from the apprehended individual, unaware that their plan has failed and he has been captured.",
