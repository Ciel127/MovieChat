 "caption": "A shark spotted a school of rainbow runner fish. It had the opportunity to eat one, but the rainbow runners are agile and hard to catch. So it waited patiently, hoping to find a weaker fish it could catch. The predator waited endlessly, excitedly far from land. A pod of five hundred dolphins sensed food nearby and were in pursuit. Their destination was the Azores, a volcanic archipelago located a thousand miles west of Portugal. The dolphins used their sonar to scan the waters ahead. They were close to their target, which was the bluefin tuna. For a single dolphin, catching these fish is challenging. To avoid wasting energy, they cooperate as a team. They drive the school of fish upwards, trapping them on the surface. Then, other predators await them. The Cory's shearwater is one of them, waiting for the dolphins to drive the prey closer to the surface. At this moment, the shearwaters can dive, reaching depths of 20 meters or even more. Once the dolphins have had their fill, they leave. The tuna then sink, marking the beginning of changes in the ocean. Deep-sea plankton begins to rise from the depths, and another hungry army is ready to meet them. Every night, as long as conditions allow, these tuna consume everything in their path. In three years, they will become one of the most formidable hunters in the ocean, weighing up to 60 kilograms. But now, they are very vulnerable. These devil rays are giants, measuring up to 8 meters in length and weighing 2 tons. The blade-like projections on both sides of their heads help them navigate.",
